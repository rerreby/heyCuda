## Hey, Cuda!
A primitive utility for Linux-based OS that shows information about your CUDA device

A created this program for my own purposes and to learn more about CUDA technology. So it probably won't be much useful for you but if you find this somehow useful after all I would be pleased.

At the moment the utulity shows:
 - device's name
 - number of multiprocessors
 - registers per multiprocessor
 - clock rate
 - total memory
 - memory BUS width
 - CUDA compute mode
 - max threads per block
 - PCI device ID
 
Cheers!
